This script updates a Fortigate Admin & SSLVPN Certificate with LetsEncrypt.

# TODO: Clean up script

This script still needs to be cleaned up, but it works for my needs at home. A co-worker was curious how I was updating my Lets Encrypt certs on my Fortigate, so I sanitized it a bit and threw it up GitHub.
